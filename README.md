# LayGenerator
Allows lay files to be generated using a user interface, rather than manually coding them.

If you do not have the .NET6 Desktop runtime installed, you can install this from Microsoft from here:

# Fixes/Improvements:
- UI fixes for Delete for Bezels
- Ability to save and load templates, or use existing files as base (lay deserialization)
- Documentation/video guide
- Add the ability to add Backdrops and Overlays to views.
